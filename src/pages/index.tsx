        Formed in 1986, the 4-Players of Colorado is a not-for-profit club that
        donates funds raised during the year to local organizations benefitting
        the Colorado LGBTQI+ community. As an LGBTQI+ social organization, we
        share an enjoyment for traveling backroads and off-road trails
        responsibly in four-wheel drive vehicles.
